# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: classification, regression
- Algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, neural networks

### Unsupervised Learning  
- Works with unlabeled data
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
- Algorithms: k-means, PCA, autoencoders

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties
- Applications: game playing, robotics, autonomous vehicles

## Popular Frameworks
- **TensorFlow**: Google's open-source framework
- **PyTorch**: Facebook's research-focused framework  
- **scikit-learn**: Simple and efficient tools for Python
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API

# Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors efficiently.

## Key Features

### Similarity Search
Vector databases excel at finding similar items based on vector representations:
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Dot product similarity

### Scalability
Modern vector databases can handle:
- Millions to billions of vectors
- Real-time queries
- Distributed architectures

## Popular Vector Databases

### Qdrant
- Open-source vector database
- Written in Rust for performance
- Supports filtering and payloads
- RESTful API

### Pinecone
- Managed vector database service
- Easy to use and scale
- Built-in monitoring

### Weaviate
- Open-source vector search engine
- GraphQL API
- Built-in vectorization modules

## Use Cases
- Semantic search
- Recommendation systems
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Image and video search
- Anomaly detection

# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Systems

RAG combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses.

## How RAG Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: Documents are processed and split into chunks
2. **Vectorization**: Text chunks are converted to embeddings
3. **Storage**: Embeddings are stored in a vector database
4. **Query Processing**: User queries are vectorized
5. **Retrieval**: Similar document chunks are retrieved
6. **Generation**: LLM generates response using retrieved context

## Benefits

### Accuracy
- Reduces hallucinations
- Provides factual, source-based answers
- Keeps information current

### Transparency  
- Shows source documents
- Enables fact-checking
- Builds user trust

### Efficiency
- No need to retrain models
- Can update knowledge by adding documents
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning

## Implementation Considerations

### Chunking Strategy
- Chunk size affects retrieval quality
- Overlap helps maintain context
- Different strategies for different content types

### Embedding Quality
- Choice of embedding model matters
- Local vs. API-based embeddings
- Domain-specific embeddings may perform better

### Retrieval Methods
- Semantic similarity (most common)
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- Metadata filtering
